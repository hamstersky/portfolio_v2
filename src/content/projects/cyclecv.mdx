This project builds on top of my research project at ITU. During my research project, I developed an algorithm for reconstructing urban traffic trajectories in a dataset based on a 10-hour video footage.

The annotation platform was built to validate the algorithm and create labeled data to further improve it. The plaform provides an interface to label trajectories and make alternative trajectories.
